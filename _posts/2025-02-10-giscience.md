I believe that reproducibiliy and replicability is very important in any scientific discipline. Geography has some quirks that may make these goals more difficult to achieve but, when possible, I think researchers should make their best effort. Because geography preports to be an empirical social science, I think its validity, especially in regards quantitative research, may be impoved with reproducible practices. Because of the contetmporary highly competitive publishing process, many papers reach concluions that arent acually evident in the data. I worry that a social sciences may be even more prone to reaching biased conclusions because the topics they sudy relate to social and political systems that have formed the modern academic environment. Reprodiucable methods may thwart some of these problems. They do, however, become become tricky with qualitative research and contextual evidence. Here I think interdisciplinary peer review may be a more effective strategy.

Doing my own research in geography, I have struggled with consistently reporting my methods and data in a reproducible way. I takes extra self-guided discipline which, unless tought systematically to young researchers, can quite overwhelming. I hope to learn more effecive esrategies for doing thtis ype of work not only in the research world but in whatever careeer I end up doing.
