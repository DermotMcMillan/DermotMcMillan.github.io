Overall I found this exercise very difficult.
I am still geeetting oriented to the repository and documentation conventions so finding stuff was my first challenge.
Second, although I've used the sf package before, I don't have a deep enough knowledge of it to know the best way to implement certain parts of the analysis (i.e aggrigate geometry by an attribute) so I found the planning process to be arduous.
If I had had previous experience with documenting workflows, partticularly for a non-gui GIS analysis, this may have gone a lot smoother.
It also would have helped to be more well versed with sf before trying to pre-plan an entire analysis because I tend to learn programs like this through trial and error and just reading documentattion doesn't work well for me.
Overall, I think that this process is very important for reproducable research but it would also require a lot of upfront work and learning on the part of the researcher.
Making a roaddmap is very important andcould save a researcher a lot of stress down the line.
I think much of the extra time I took came from actually learning what was possible for spatial analysis in R. 

I will post the link to my plan when I finish it up tomorrow morning.
